Better forms are shorter, clearer, and confidence-building.

## Form structure that works

- Name and email as required minimum
- Business type for qualification
- Short project description for context
- Clear response-time promise below submit button

## Confirmation page essentials

After submit, tell users exactly what happens next and when they should hear from you.
