A delayed launch usually means delayed revenue.

## Ideal launch target

For most local service businesses, 5 to 7 business days is realistic when:

- Decision makers are available for quick approvals
- Content requirements are clear
- Site architecture is conversion-focused

## Speed without chaos

Use a fixed page framework and revision windows. This keeps the project moving while protecting quality.
