Your homepage has one job: move the right visitor to contact you.

## Use this conversion copy structure

1. Problem-aware headline focused on customer outcome
2. One clear value proposition in plain language
3. Fast proof: reviews, numbers, case examples
4. Offer clarity: what is included and what it costs
5. Strong call to action repeated across the page

## Remove friction

Use plain language, not industry jargon. Put your contact path above the fold and again near proof sections.

## Add urgency without hype

Instead of fake scarcity, use service certainty:

- Typical launch timeline
- Average response time
- Number of businesses served
