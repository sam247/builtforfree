Local SEO helps your website appear for nearby customers who are ready to buy.

## Core setup checklist

- One focused page per core service
- Location intent naturally included in headings and body copy
- Unique meta title and description per page
- Consistent NAP details (name, address, phone) where relevant
- FAQ sections that match real customer search queries

## Avoid these common mistakes

- Targeting broad keywords with no local intent
- Thin pages with generic copy
- Missing trust signals and conversion elements

## Track outcomes

Measure calls, form submissions, and booked jobs, not just ranking movement.
