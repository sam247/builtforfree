Your CTA should reduce hesitation and make next steps obvious.

## Effective CTA formulas

- Action + outcome: "Claim my free website"
- Action + timeframe: "Get your website plan within 24 hours"
- Action + risk reversal: "Get started, no upfront build cost"

Use one primary CTA label site-wide for consistency.
